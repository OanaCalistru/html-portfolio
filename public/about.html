        <p>Hi I'm Oana, a veterinarian trying to get into programming. I've chosen Frontend development because I feel I can find my motivation in making things look pretty.</p>
        <p>I am also a gamer, so I love spending time in front of the computer.</p>
        <p>I love to eat but also to stay in shape so I try to balance those things in my life with the help of my fianc√©.</p>
